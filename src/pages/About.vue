    <h1>Transcript: Kim Jong-Un’s October 10th Parade Speech</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      Dear comrades, The founding anniversary of our glorious Party has come.
      The night of great glory has come. At last on this glorious night we are
      greeting the Party’s founding anniversary of this year, which was beset
      with unprecedented difficulties; I don’t know why, but this fact alone
      moves me too much. Greeting the 75th founding anniversary of our great
      Party, I, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of
      Korea, extend heartfelt congratulations to all those who have glorified
      this October holiday with great honour and pride. I extend warm thanks and
      congratulations to all our people. Comrades, On this night of the great
      holiday, the streets in the capital city and this square are so splendid
      and seethe with pleasure and pride, but we must not forget that this
      glorious moment of today is being defended by the many Party members,
      workers and service personnel of our revolutionary armed forces who are
      performing unassuming efforts and devotion across the country. How many
      people have made devoted efforts overcoming harsh circumstances this year
      so as to bring about and defend this glorious moment of today! How many
      challenges have we overcome to come as far as here! In particular, our
      service personnel performed devotion on the anti-epidemic front and the
      front of removing the aftereffects of natural disasters which we had to
      face this year unexpectedly. No one would approach their patriotic and
      heroic devotion without shedding tears of gratitude. They would say that
      defending their country, people and revolution is a task inherent to the
      People’s Army, but the pains they have taken are too great. They have
      undertaken to perform too many tasks and have taken too great pains. This
      is why I feel deep regret for them, and I feel pain in my heart as they
      are not all here at this glorious night with us. At this very moment, many
      of our service personnel are courageously striving on the anti-epidemic
      front and at the rehabilitation project sites far away from this glorious
      Kim Il Sung Square in defence of the security of the state and safety of
      the people. Our army is performing its mission as a motive force of
      national defence with such credit in the face of unforeseen challenges
      posed by the epidemic and the forces of nature, as well as the military
      threats by the hostile forces. I extend the highest tribute to their
      ardent loyal and filial devotion to our state and people and warm thanks
      to all the service personnel. I also offer my militant encouragement and
      thanks to my most dependable combatants of the divisions of the WPK
      members from the capital city, our hardcore force. They are patriots who
      deserve to be present here, but they volunteered, after completing their
      tasks in rehabilitation projects, to other disaster areas instead of
      returning to Pyongyang where there are their dear homes. My militant
      greetings and thanks go also to other working people across the country. I
      hope that only happiness and joy will come to the families that have
      settled down in new villages and homes after getting rid of the
      aftereffects of the natural calamities, and to other families across the
      country. I hope that our children’s happy dreams will come true all the
      time. Availing myself of this opportunity, I offer my heartfelt
      consolation to all those around the world who are still combating the
      disease caused by the malignant virus, and do pray from the bottom of my
      heart that health, happiness and laughter of all people would be
      guaranteed. I also send this warm wish of mine to our dear fellow
      countrymen in the south, and hope that this health crisis would come to an
      end as early as possible and the day would come when the north and south
      take each other’s hand again. Comrades, We all have gathered on this
      October celebration square with valuable successes and fruits of labour,
      which we have achieved with all our effort. It was not so easy for us to
      come as far as here. We had to fight one arduous struggle after another
      and overcome countless ordeals. Although the 75-year-long history of our
      Party was fraught with difficulties, every day and every step was truly
      arduous and trying from the outset of this year in particular as
      unexpected grave challenges and obstacles cropped up. We have come to this
      meaningful place with the pride and honour of having braved them all. This
      gathering, which the world people would admire, demonstrates that we have
      overcome all the calamities that troubled us and blocked our way and that
      we have attained with success our justifiable fighting goals. Dear
      comrades, Today we are greeting the 75th founding anniversary of our Party
      on a grand scale. No other country in the world would celebrate a party’s
      founding anniversary as a happy holiday and grand auspicious event of all
      its people as our country does. As I stand here tonight, which is emotive
      and delightful and brims over with the great joy of all our people, I am
      afraid that I don’t know what to say first to them. I thought over what I
      would say first at this moment, when we will be looking back upon every
      page of our Party’s 75-year history filled with glory, but my heartfelt,
      sincere word for our people is only one, thanks. First of all, I thank
      them for being healthy free from disease. I wanted to say this without
      fail. I thank them for their good health without any one of them having
      fallen victim to the malignant virus. The fact that we have defended all
      our people from the harmful epidemic disease sweeping the whole world can
      be said to be a natural duty and success of our Party. However, I am moved
      by this success, and as I see their healthy appearance, I can find no word
      other than thanks. Today’s victory that is striking the world with
      admiration is a great victory achieved by our people themselves. For our
      Party, the life of every one of our people is more precious than anything
      else, and their good health means the very existence of our Party, state
      and everything on this land. In this world, however, there are too many
      unstable elements threatening and attempting to harm the priceless life of
      our people. So, as a matter of fact, at the beginning of this year, I had
      big worries and fear owing to the onset of the world health crisis and
      unfavourable situations around us. However, our people got rise to their
      feet with great perseverance in absolute support of and trust in the
      measures taken by the Party and the state, and not only safeguarded their
      destiny resolutely but also bravely overcame severe hardships and trials
      with animation. But for such excellent people who worry, care and protect
      one another and but for the socialist society, in which these people live
      in cooperation with a high sense of patriotism and a high level of
      self-consciousness, we would not have prevented the horrible catastrophe.
      As all our people turned out as one in the struggle for defending their
      state, themselves and their children, becoming the motive force of the
      anti-epidemic work of their own accord, the country’s anti-epidemic sector
      which was backward and lacking in everything could be revitalized, and
      anti-epidemic stability which is inconceivable to others could be
      maintained. It is very grateful and encouraging for me that everybody
      lives in a large harmonious family although life is not affluent yet and
      they are healthy without even one of them having fallen victim to the evil
      virus. There are no grateful people in the world other than ours who truly
      understand the difficult situations facing the state and cope with them,
      regarding them as their household affairs. On this planet at present, our
      country is the only one that is faced with huge challenges and
      difficulties, like dealing with the anti-epidemic emergency and recovering
      from the catastrophic natural disasters, when everything is in short
      supply owing to the harsh and prolonged sanctions. All of these hardships
      are undoubtedly a heavy burden and pain for every family and every citizen
      in our country. However, our people are grateful patriots who place
      national affairs before their family ones, share every difficulty
      experienced by the state with it, and firmly support their country with
      their sincere sweats and efforts. That is why our Party braves all sorts
      of national hardships by believing in and relying on them, who always turn
      out as one if it unburdens itself of the situations of the country. Our
      people have always been grateful to our Party, but it is none other than
      themselves who surely deserve a bow of gratitude. Over the past 75 years
      our people have supported the Party single-heartedly and defended our
      sacred revolutionary cause by shedding sweat and even their blood
      unsparingly and unhesitatingly. The secret of how our Party, which has
      followed the revolutionary road, most arduous and beset with trials, has
      adorned this bloody road with victory and glory is that our people have
      sincerely trusted and supported it and defended its cause. No one can
      think about even a moment of our Party’s glorious 75-year history without
      our great people, an omnipotent creator of history. They have always
      provided it with wisdom and resourcefulness as a wise mentor, infused it
      with inexhaustible strength and courage, defended it at the cost of their
      lives, supported it sincerely and turned its plans and lines into reality.
      When it called on them to bring about a great upsurge, the great people
      responded to it with the mettle of Chollima; when it mapped out an
      operation for grand construction, they responded to it with the speed
      campaign; they thus translated the Party’s decisions without fail going
      through fire and water. As these great people have always been with our
      Party, it has always been firm and able to record miracles in the annals
      of this land whatever the adversity. Seeing the images of our people who
      have won victory for the great October holiday overcoming all manner of
      hardships with boundless loyal and filial devotion, indomitable fighting
      spirit and sincere efforts, I feel with great pride the almighty strength
      with which they would follow and defend the Party for another 75 years,
      nay, 750 years and even 7 500 years Comrades,
      <b
        >Our people have placed trust, as high as sky and as deep as sea, on me,
        but I have failed to always live up to it satisfactorily.</b
      >
      I am really sorry for that. Although I am entrusted with the important
      responsibility to lead this country upholding the cause of the great
      Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il thanks to the trust of all the
      people, my efforts and sincerity have not been sufficient enough to rid
      our people of the difficulties in their life. Our people, however, have
      always believed and absolutely trusted me, and supported my choice and
      determination, whatever it is. Even if it may mean suffering more, our
      people’s trust in me and our Party is always absolute and steadfast. Such
      ardent and sincere trust and encouragement is the most valuable wealth for
      me, which cannot be bartered with any fame and millions of tons of gold,
      and inexhaustible strength which encourages me to have no fear and know no
      impossibility. As I enjoy this greatest trust which no one in this world
      can ever expect, I have been able to confront without hesitation all
      manner of challenges remembering the mission and will to make selfless,
      devoted efforts for the good of the people, jump into do-or-die battles,
      which would lead even to a war, and uncompromisingly cope with the
      disasters unprecedented in history. I will cherish it as the highest
      honour to have, serve and struggle for such excellent people. I solemnly
      swear once again in this place that I will live up to the people’s trust
      without fail even if my body is torn and crushed to pieces on the way of
      defending their great trust and that I will remain faithful to that trust.
      Dear guests and other people across the country, Thank you, indeed. I
      extend my heartfelt thanks to you with humble reverence along with the
      hearts of Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. Comrades, It is our
      Party’s and my first and foremost mission and steadfast will to firmly
      defend our people, hold them in greater respect and make them lead a happy
      life envying nothing. Our Party has already built up the strongest
      military capability of safeguarding peace, with which to firmly defend
      socialism, the dignity and lifeline of our people, and to make our people
      enjoy the benefits of prosperity generation after generation on this land,
      eternally free from war. Today’s ranks of military parade lined in gallant
      array will clearly show how the Workers’ Party of Korea has trained its
      revolutionary army and how powerful the army’s strength is. As everyone
      will clearly see today, comparing it with the military parade held in this
      place in celebration of the 70th founding anniversary of the WPK only five
      years ago, the modernity of our military forces has remarkably improved
      and anyone can easily guess the speed of its development. We have a
      powerful large contingent of faithful and competent personnel in the
      sector of defence science and technology and workers in the munitions
      industry, who are firmly equipped with their Party’s revolutionary
      ideology and truly serve the interests of their revolution. Our military
      capability has developed and changed to such an extent that no one can
      make little of and keep parallel with it. We have built a deterrent with
      which we can satisfactorily control and manage any military threats that
      we are facing or may face. Our military capability is changing in the rate
      of its growth and in its quality and quantity in our own style and in
      accordance with our demands and our timetable. Our Party defined the
      military capability with which to overpower in advance the forces that may
      dare to threaten or infringe on the rights to independence and existence
      of our state and people as the most assured and strong national defence
      capability. And it has made every effort to possess military forces that
      can achieve the purpose and is now attaining the upgraded targets
      steadily. We will continue to strengthen the war deterrent, the righteous
      self-defence means, so as to contain and control all the dangerous
      attempts and intimidatory acts by the hostile forces, including their
      sustained and aggravating nuclear threat. Our war deterrent, which is
      intended to defend the rights to independence and existence of our state
      and safeguard peace in the region, will never be abused or used as a means
      for preemptive strike. But, if, and if, any forces infringe upon the
      security of our state and attempt to have recourse to military force
      against us, I will enlist all our most powerful offensive strength in
      advance to punish them. I never want that our military strength would aim
      at someone else. We clarify that our war deterrent is being developed not
      for aiming at others. We are developing it in order to defend ourselves.
      If we don’t have our own strength, the only thing we have to do is to wipe
      the streaming tears and blood though our fists are clenched. Our Party,
      with powerful military strength, will guarantee the sovereignty of the
      country and reliable security of its territory and safeguard the eternal
      safety, peace and future of the state and people. Comrades, Thanks to our
      revolutionary armed forces equipped with the revolutionary ideology of the
      WPK, unbounded loyalty and filial piety to the country and people and
      powerful up-to-date weapons embodying the strength and soul of our people,
      any aggressive force will never be able to make little of our sacred
      country nor dare to check the advance of the Korean people. What is left
      now is to ensure that our people enjoy a sufficient and civilized life to
      the full free from difficulties any longer. Our Party will invariably
      administer and ceaselessly expand the advantageous policies and measures,
      which are aimed at improving the people’s wellbeing and providing more
      benefits to them, and bring as earlier as possible the ideal society of
      prosperity that our people are dreaming of. Sharing destiny with the
      people in the face of severe trials and experiencing the united strength
      of our people till now, our Party has come to know well what it should do
      in the future. The Eighth Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea will
      advance plans and detailed targets for doing it, and our Party’s struggle
      for providing the people with happiness will develop onto a new stage. The
      further we develop, the more rampant the reactionary forces of all hues
      may become, and more unexpected trials may face us. However, they will be
      nothing compared with what we have experienced until now and we have the
      strength and confidence with which to overcome them all. The
      single-hearted unity of the Party and the masses of the people
      consolidated in the long course of the struggle and the talent force and
      asset for self-sustenance provided by our socialism–these will surely
      become a powerful force that propels and accelerates our advance. Our
      Party and people, who have achieved everything that others would not have
      dared to attempt by surmounting all manner of immeasurable trials and
      hardships that others had never experienced, will start their advance
      towards new development and prosperity with greater courage and
      confidence, unusual passion and preparedness. I will ensure that all Party
      organizations, the government and power and military organs make more and
      more strict demands on themselves, direct strenuous efforts and work with
      sincerity for our people and for bringing a better tomorrow to them. The
      ideal of our people is great, and the day when it is realized will surely
      come. I will direct all my efforts to realizing the great ideal so as to
      ensure that innovations, development and substantial changes which
      everyone can feel are made in the struggle for attaining higher targets in
      socialist construction. Comrades, we have become strong and are becoming
      stronger in the midst of trials. Time is by our side. Let us all advance
      vigorously towards a bright future of socialism, towards a fresh victory!
      Last, I once again extend thanks to all the people for being in good
      health free from any disease. And I also extend my heartfelt thanks to
      them for invariably trusting in our Party. Long live our great people!
